Fitness Goal Tracker
Fitness Goal Tracker is a web application designed to help users set, track, and achieve their fitness goals, such as steps taken, workout sessions, or daily water intake. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to log daily progress, view their achievements, and receive performance summaries. Built for beginners learning frameworks like Vue.js or React, it utilizes localStorage to ensure data persistence in the browser while focusing on core concepts of modern frontend frameworks.

Project Context
Fitness Goal Tracker allows users to manage their personal fitness goals, such as walking a certain number of steps, drinking a set amount of water, or completing workout sessions. It is a great way to track fitness goals on a day-to-day basis, offering insights into their progress and motivating them to stay on track.

Core Features
1. Goal Management (CRUD)
Users can create, read, update, and delete their fitness goals.

Each goal can include details like the target (e.g., 10,000 steps or 8 cups of water) and category (e.g., "Steps", "Water", "Workout").

2. Track Daily Progress
A form allows users to log their daily progress for each goal (e.g., steps taken, workouts completed).

3. Goal List
The app displays a list of all active goals, showing details like:

The goal’s name.

The current progress.

A visual indicator (such as a progress bar or percentage) to track how close the user is to reaching the goal.

4. Performance Summary
A section that provides an overview of key statistics, such as:

The total number of goals achieved in the week.

The average progress across all goals.

5. Local Storage
All goals and progress data are saved in the browser’s localStorage, ensuring data persists between sessions without requiring a backend server.
